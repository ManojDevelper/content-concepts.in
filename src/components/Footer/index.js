              damages, lost profits, or damages resulting from lost data, breach of confidentiality, or
              business interruption) resulting from the performance of ContentConcepts’ services, the use
              or inability to use the ContentConcepts website or the material contained on the website,

              damages.
              In no event is ContentConcepts liable for damages in excess of the amount paid by a
              customer for the service in question. ContentConcepts has created this website and

              breached. You specifically agree that ContentConcepts is not liable for any offensive,
              defamatory, or illegal conduct of any user. If you are dissatisfied with any ContentConcepts material, or with any of ContentConcepts terms and conditions, your sole and exclusive
              remedy is to discontinue using ContentConcepts services.
